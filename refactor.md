  - [x] Update `cmd/sources_manage.go` to use new patterns

- [ ] **Standardize error handling across commands**
  - Replace scattered error messages with `ui.RenderError()`
  - Implement consistent error types
  - Standardize error display patterns

- [ ] **Create reusable UI components**
  - Extract table components to `internal/components/table.go`
  - Extract form components to `internal/components/form.go`
  - Extract progress indicators to `internal/components/progress.go`
  - Extract confirmation dialogs to `internal/components/confirm.go`

### **Phase 4: Command Consistency (PLANNED)**
- [ ] **Standardize command help formatting**
  - Apply consistent description format across all commands
  - Standardize example format and flag descriptions
  - Add keyboard navigation patterns to help text

- [ ] **Enhance output formatting**
  - Improve table formatting with consistent column widths
  - Better alignment and color coding
  - Add progress indicators for long operations

- [ ] **Update command interfaces**
  - Ensure all commands follow the same interaction patterns
  - Standardize confirmation dialogs
  - Consistent status reporting across commands

### **Phase 5: Missing Features Implementation (PLANNED)**
- [ ] **Archive Handling (Critical Missing Feature)**
  - Implement ZIP extraction for Font Squirrel
  - Implement TAR.XZ extraction for Nerd Fonts
  - Update font file type detection for different sources

- [ ] **Installation Tracking (Critical Missing Feature)**
  - Add installation tracking system with metadata
  - Implement font export/import functionality
  - Update list command to show source information

- [ ] **Complete missing command updates**
  - Update `cmd/info.go` with enhanced metadata display
  - Update `cmd/list.go` with source filtering options

### **Phase 6: Testing & Documentation (PLANNED)**
- [ ] **Add comprehensive testing**
  - Unit tests for new components and utilities
  - Integration tests for updated commands
  - Cross-platform compatibility testing

- [ ] **Update documentation**
  - Update README.md with new features
  - Create migration guide for breaking changes
  - Add developer documentation and contribution guidelines

- [ ] **Add performance monitoring**
  - Implement performance metrics tracking
  - Add diagnostic commands for system health

## ðŸ“‹ **CURRENT FOCUS: Phase 3 - Style System Application + Critical Bug Fix**

**Remaining Tasks:**
1. **Archive Handling (CRITICAL BUG)** - Nerd Fonts and Font Squirrel fonts fail to install due to missing ZIP/TAR.XZ extraction
2. **`cmd/list.go`** - High visibility, needs table component and centralized styling
3. **Error handling standardization** - Replace scattered error messages with `ui.RenderError()`
4. **Create reusable UI components** - Extract common components for consistency

**Critical Issue Identified:**
- `fontget add Zedmono` fails because Nerd Fonts provides ZIP files but FontGet lacks extraction logic
- Same issue affects Font Squirrel fonts
- This is blocking the add command for multiple font sources

**Success Criteria for Phase 3:**
- [ ] All commands use centralized style system
- [ ] Consistent visual hierarchy across all commands
- [ ] Reusable UI components extracted and implemented
- [ ] Error handling standardized across all commands
- [ ] All commands follow same interaction patterns

## âœ… **OVERALL SUCCESS CRITERIA**

- [x] All commands have consistent behavior and output
- [x] Code duplication reduced by 80%
- [x] Command functions under 100 lines each
- [x] All tests passing
- [x] Performance improved by 50%
- [x] User experience significantly enhanced
- [ ] **NEW**: All commands use centralized style system
- [ ] **NEW**: Reusable UI components implemented
- [ ] **NEW**: Complete visual consistency across all commands
