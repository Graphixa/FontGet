    - [ ] Maintain consistent colors and symbols

- [ ] **Enhance font installation feedback with detailed variant reporting**
  - [ ] Update `cmd/add.go` to show detailed installation header
    - [ ] Add header: `"Installing 'FontName' from 'SourceName'"`
    - [ ] Use `ui.PageSubtitle.Render()` for the header
  - [ ] Update `cmd/add.go` to show individual variant status with symbols
    - [ ] Change successful installation to: `"‚úì FontName Variant (Installed to user scope)"`
    - [ ] Change skipped installation to: `"‚úì FontName Variant (Skipped - already installed)"`
    - [ ] Change failed installation to: `"‚úó FontName Variant (Failed - [error reason])"`
    - [ ] Use `ui.FeedbackSuccess.Render("Installed to [scope] scope")` for success
    - [ ] Use `ui.FeedbackWarning.Render("Skipped - already installed")` for skipped
    - [ ] Use `ui.FeedbackError.Render("Failed - [error reason]")` for failed
  - [ ] Apply same pattern to `cmd/remove.go` for removal operations
    - [ ] Add header: `"Removing 'FontName' from 'SourceName'"`
    - [ ] Change successful removal to: `"‚úì FontName Variant (Removed from user scope)"`
    - [ ] Change skipped removal to: `"‚úì FontName Variant (Skipped - not installed)"`
    - [ ] Change failed removal to: `"‚úó FontName Variant (Failed - [error reason])"`

## üìã **CURRENT FOCUS: Phase 3 - Complete Style System Implementation**

**Immediate Priority:**
1. **Update remaining commands** - `remove.go`, `list.go`, `info.go`, `cache.go`, `config.go`, `completion.go`
2. **Standardize error handling** - Replace hardcoded errors with `ui.RenderError()`
3. **Create reusable components** - Extract common UI patterns

**Critical Issues to Address:**
- `fontget add Zedmono` fails because Nerd Fonts provides ZIP files but FontGet lacks extraction logic
