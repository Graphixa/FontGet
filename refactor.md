---

## ðŸ§¹ **Code Quality & Cleanup Milestone**

### **Phase 4: Code Quality Audit & Cleanup**

#### **Debug & Logging Cleanup**
- [ ] **Review debug output consistency** - Ensure all debug messages follow the same format and provide useful information
- [ ] **Remove redundant debug statements** - Clean up duplicate or unnecessary debug output
- [ ] **Standardize debug message formatting** - Use consistent patterns for debug output across all commands
- [ ] **Optimize debug performance** - Ensure debug output doesn't impact performance when disabled

#### **Code Quality Assessment**
- [ ] **Identify code smells** - Review codebase for common issues like:
  - [ ] Long functions that should be broken down
  - [ ] Duplicate code that can be extracted
  - [ ] Complex conditional logic that can be simplified
  - [ ] Inconsistent naming conventions
  - [ ] Unused imports or variables
- [ ] **Refactor complex functions** - Break down large functions into smaller, more maintainable pieces
- [ ] **Improve error handling** - Standardize error handling patterns across the codebase
- [ ] **Add missing documentation** - Ensure all public functions have proper documentation
- [ ] **Optimize imports** - Remove unused imports and organize import statements

#### **Performance & Memory Optimization**
- [ ] **Memory usage audit** - Identify potential memory leaks or excessive allocations
- [ ] **Function call optimization** - Reduce unnecessary function calls in hot paths
- [ ] **String operations optimization** - Use more efficient string operations where possible
- [ ] **Goroutine cleanup** - Ensure proper cleanup of goroutines and channels

- [ ] **Performance benchmarking** - Establish baseline performance metrics
- [ ] **Memory profiling** - Identify memory usage patterns and optimization opportunities

---

## ðŸ§¹ Targeted Cleanup: list.go and platform.go

### list.go
- [ ] Extract `buildParsedFont(path, scope) ParsedFont` to encapsulate metadata extraction and display-name choice (uses TypographicFamily/Style when present).
- [ ] Reduce debug noise: keep only
  - [ ] Scan summary (files scanned per scope)
  - [ ] Family grouping summary (family name, file count)
  - [ ] Unique variant count in `--detailed`
- [ ] Keep performance: one metadata read per file; no re-parsing in grouping/rendering.
- [ ] Consider style ordering (Thinâ†’Black) for nicer `--detailed` output (non-blocking).

### internal/platform/platform.go
- [ ] Split `parseNameTable` into smaller helpers:
  - [ ] `forEachNameRecord(data, fn(record))` â€“ decoding bounds/UTF-16 handling.
  - [ ] `selectPreferredNames(records)` â€“ policy to choose NameID16/17 with fallback.
- [ ] Add typed constants for name IDs and platforms (e.g., NameIDFamily=1, NameIDTypoFamily=16, PlatformMicrosoft=3, PlatformUnicode=0, PlatformMacintosh=1).
- [ ] Ensure `extractFontMetadataFullFile` also populates `TypographicFamily/Style` when available from sfnt (or marks as unavailable) to keep parity with header-only path.
- [ ] Unit-test `parseNameTable` with synthetic name tables covering:
  - [ ] Multiple platform/language records
  - [ ] Absence of NameID16/17 (fallback to 1/2)
  - [ ] Mixed encodings and language IDs

### Crossâ€‘Platform Name Selection Policy (Important)
- Current temporary preference leans to Microsoft/English (platform=3, language=1033) when present because itâ€™s the most complete on Windows Nerd Fonts.
- Final crossâ€‘platform policy to implement and test:
  1. Prefer NameID16/17 regardless of platform.
  2. Among multiple 16/17 records, prefer Unicode entries in this order: PlatformUnicode(0) > PlatformMicrosoft(3) > PlatformMacintosh(1).
  3. Within a platform, prefer language matching system locale; fallback to English (1033) if present; otherwise choose a deterministic Unicode record (Platform 0) if any; if not available, choose the lowest language ID under Microsoft (3). Only if no 16/17 fit these, fall back to NameID 1/2 using the same order, and if still empty, finally use filename parsing.
  4. Only if 16/17 absent, fall back to NameID 1/2 using the same platform/language order.
- [ ] Implement the above selection order and verify on macOS/Linux/Windows samples (Roboto, Source Code Pro, JetBrainsMono, ZedMono, Fira Code, Terminess).

### Documentation
- [ ] Document the final name-table selection policy in `docs/codebase.md` and reference it in `list-plan.md` to avoid regressions.
